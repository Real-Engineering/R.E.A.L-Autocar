# Autocar

## Our Goal

Our focus lies in crafting autonomous vehicles using renewable materials and powering them sustainably. We aim to build a self-driving go-kart sized vehicle, able to transport people and/or objects across short distances. Our goals include having autonomous steering and road detection to enable our vehicle to have adaptive cruise control, as well as object avoidance. In the future, we aim to have GPS functionality to allow our vehicle to travel farther distances.

We also want to make machine learning, control systems, and autonomous vehicles more accessible to members of the community by sharing our designs on both the software and hardware side, making it easier for people to build similar projects.

## Our Phases

| Phase       | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Phase One   | Manual Driving: <br> 1. Design and build Chassis <br> 2. Implement Motors |
| Phase Two   | Auto Steer & Cruise Control: <br> 1. Add power steering to allow motor controlled steering operations. <br> 2. Software controlled throttle. <br> 3. Sensor based object avoidance (Infrared or Ultrasound). |
| Phase Three | Camera Implementation: <br> 1. Camera based lane detection. <br> 2. Camera assisted object detection. |
| Phase Four  | Navigation: <br> 1. GPS implementation for longer autonomous travel distance. |
